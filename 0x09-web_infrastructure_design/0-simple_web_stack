What is a server?
A server is a computer that supplies other computers on a network with resources, data, services, and programs. A server could be physical as well as virtual (Virtual Machine).

What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?
CNAME. That is a Canonical name record that serves as an alias to the domain name foobar.com

What is the role of the web server?
The role of the web server in this case Nginx is to handle http(s) requests from the browser/client computer. It finds the requested filers on the server and if found serves them to the client.

Role of the Application Server?
This handles the logic of the web application. It generates dynamic content and interacts with the web server and database to produce customized responses for each client's request.

Role of the Database:
This stores and manages data for the website. It can also contain user information

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?
It uses HTTP or HTTPS - the secured version.

Issues With the One-Server Infrastructure:
SPOF. If the server goes down due to hardware failure, software issues, or maintenance, the website becomes inaccessible 

Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic. A single server can not handle too much incoming traffic and will result in slow response and crashes in peak hours

Downtime when maintenance is needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted). This will result in the entire site or sites going offline for a software or hardware upgrade.
