For every additional element, why you are adding it

Firewalls: Firewalls are crucial steps for enhancing security. They will filter incoming and outgoing connections to the load balancer and servers. They can also protect against DDoS, SQL injection, and brute force attacks.

Monitoring Clients: The addition of monitoring clients to this setup will help track the performance of components in real-time, providing detailed insights into CPU usage, memory utilization, network bandwidth, and disk I/O.

SSL Certificate: This encrypts data transmitted between the clients and the web servers to protect sensitive information that will be transmitted. It provides authentication and trust ensuring users communicating with the servers, are not imposters.

What are firewalls for?:
Firewalls provide a layer of security. They filter both incoming and outgoing connections from the servers and load balancers. They Limit Exposure by controlling which ports are open and which types of traffic are allowed.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?:
HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server. This encryption is vital for protecting sensitive information from being intercepted by third parties. It ensures that data like login credentials, personal information, and payment details remain confidential during transmission.


How the monitoring tool is collecting data?:
Monitoring tools collect data variously and they include agent-based monitoring which is a method where software modules are installed on the servers or devices being monitored. These agents collect data about the system's performance, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, network statistics, and application-specific metrics. The agents then send this data back to the monitoring servers. Then there is log file analysis, here the monitoring tools collect log files generated by the operating system, applications, and network devices.

Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS:
First I will choose a monitoring tool like New Relic and then configure the web server for Monitoring. I will ensure that my web server is configured to expose the necessary metrics. Next, I set up the monitoring agent. I will use Log Analysis - If my web server logs every request, I can use log analysis tools to calculate QPS. I will then set up my monitoring tool to collect QPS data at regular intervals. This might involve configuring the tool to query the web server's status page or parse its logs at a set frequency. Depending on my server's capabilities I will set up thresholds and alerts. It is important to regularly review the QPS data to understand my web server's performance patterns and then optimize based on the data.
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure
Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
When SSL termination occurs at the load balancer, traffic between the load balancer and the web/application servers is often unencrypted. This can be a security risk, especially if the internal network is not completely secure or if the servers are located in different data centers or cloud regions.
Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue?
There is a single point of failure. If this server goes down, it will become impossible to perform write operations leading to service disruption. There is also a limit to how much load the server can handle.
Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server) might be a problem
Having all components on the same server increases the security risk. If an attacker compromises one component, they gain access to the others as well. Also, it's harder to scale components independently when they are all on the same server. For instance, if the database needs more resources due to increased load, you would have to scale the entire server, which is not cost-effective.
